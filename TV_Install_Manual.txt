First You have to install some of the prerequisites like:

*libmfile*, *gawk*, *g77*, *Xaw*, *Xaw3d*, and *motif* 

These prerequisites can vary according to your linux systems but you will get any substitue or suported library for these packages except libmfile!!

So that's why I am sharing this libmfile source code along with the tv source code file.

(::::Suggestion to use super user for the installation::::)

/////////// LIBMFILE Configuration ///////

-> extract the libmfile-1.0.7.tar.gz 
-> change the directory to this extracted libmfile-1.0.7" 
-> now configure it by: ./configure   #If it denies for any permission then give this file a permission by using command: chmod +x configure
-> then make it by: make
-> and finally install using: make install

*If it ask for any permission then use super user mode!!

////////// TV Configureation ////////////

-> extract the tv-1.9.13.tar.gz 
-> change the directory to this extracted file "tv-1.9.13" 
-> now configure it by: ./configure    #If it denies for any permission then give this file a permission by using command: chmod +x configure
-> then make it by: make
-> and finally install using: make install

*Most common error in this build is that libmfile error or some missing xaw or xaw3d libraries. So make those were successfully installed in your system!! 

////////// Post building process ///////

Now if we try to open "tv" it will show you this kinda error:

"tv: error while loading shared libraries: libmfile-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

-> To resolve this issue, we have to link the path of that installed libmfile directory, which is in your /usr/local/lib/ directory. 

So you can try to link that in your .bashrc file using the command: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  



Hopefully, you can use tv by these following processes:)
